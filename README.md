  • Software development, Java is my main language and recently I have been learning and using Spring services like Boot and JPA for the backend of web apps 🍵
  • Machine learning and the design of models that will likely only continue to play a larger part in all of our futures 🤖
  • Competitive programming and algorithm design 🏅
  • Interworking of ditributed / scalable systems 🌐
  • Learning multiple languages - currently I can code *something* in C++, C, C#, and python 🐍
